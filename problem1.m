%% Solve for electric field between nanowire electrodes
% CONT: Solve 3D Laplace's Equation in Cartesian Coords to find V then E
% BCS: V(y=0) = 0; V(y=s) = 1

%% Determine how electro-optic performance varies w/ respect to nanowire
% width "d" and nanowire separation distance "s"


%% Estimate maximum speed of modulation based on resisitive & capacitive
% properties


%% TODO: ASK QUESTIONS
% 1. Is E field direction incorrect in Figure 2?
% 2. Is there a specific quantity for max speed of modulation? Same as
% bandwidth for RC low pass filter?
% 3. If so, can we just look up equations for finding/estimating R & C,
% including material property values e.g. silver nanowire
% resistivity/conductivity?
% 4. "Account for a nonuniform dielectric constant" but epsilon_r for both
% problems are constant?
